# SemEval-2014-Task-1
In this project, I will focus on building a model for multi-output learning using the SemEval 2014 Task 1 dataset. This dataset contains text samples, each associated with multiple labels, reflecting complex relationships inherent in real-world data. 

The competition aims to evaluate computational models that measure the similarity between pairs of sentences. Given two text fragments, the goal is to assign a similarity score that reflects their meaning closeness, which is useful in applications such as machine translation, information retrieval, and text summarization.

This project will provide valuable insights into how machine learning can effectively deal with multi-label classification challenges.
